Question,text
What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?,"Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the 
learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model underfit-
ting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy 
and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the 
test set.
Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algo-
rithm you’re using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive 
to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your 
model to overfit the data. You’ll be carrying too much noise from your 
training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.
The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning 
error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance and a bit of 
irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if 
you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose 
bias but gain some variance — in order to get the optimally reduced 
amount of error, you’ll have to tradeoff bias and variance. You don’t 
want either high bias or high variance in your model."
"What is the difference between supervised and unsu-
pervised machine learning?","Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in 
order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you’ll need to 
first label the data you’ll use to train the model to classify data into 
your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not 
require labeling data explicitly."
How is KNN different from k-means clustering?,"K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while 
k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the 
mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that 
in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you 
want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor 
part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and 
a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually 
learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the 
distance between different points.
The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is 
thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t — and is thus unsu-
pervised learning."
Explain how a ROC curve works.,"The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between 
true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. 
It’s often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of 
the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trig-
ger a false alarm (false positives)."
Define precision and recall.,"Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives 
your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there 
are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive pre-
dictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives 
your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually 
claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context 
of a case where you’ve predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 
oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are 
actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% 
precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the 
apples) are correct."
"What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine 
learning context?","Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given 
what is known as prior knowledge.
Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition 
sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population 
and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of 
actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the 
flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population 
only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 
60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?
Bayes’ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Pos-
itive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.6*0.05)(True Positive Rate of a 
Condition Sample) + (.5*0.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population)  = 
0.0594 or 5.94% chance of getting a flu.
Bayes’ Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that 
most notably includes the Naive Bayes classifier. That’s something 
important to consider when you’re faced with machine learning inter-
view questions."
Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?,"Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive 
Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is 
virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probabil-
ity is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of 
components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a 
condition probably never met in real life.
As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier 
that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably 
naively recommend you a pickle ice cream."
"Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regulariza-
tion.","L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 
is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 
or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the 
terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior."
"What’s the difference between Type I and Type II 
error?","Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. 
Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened 
when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is 
happening when in fact something is.
A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a 
man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant 
woman she isn’t carrying a baby."
What’s a Fourier transform?,"A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic func-
tions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this more 
intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, it’s how we find the rec-
ipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes 
and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a 
signal from time to frequency domain — it’s a very common way to 
extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sen-
sor data."
"What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with 
other machine learning algorithms?","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with 
neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles 
from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled 
or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an 
unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data 
through the use of neural nets."
"What’s the difference between a generative and dis-
criminative model?","A generative model will learn categories of data while a discrimina-
tive model will simply learn the distinction between different catego-
ries of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform 
generative models on classification tasks."
"What cross-validation technique would you use on a 
time series dataset?","Instead of using standard k-folds cross-validation, you have to pay 
attention to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed 
data — it is inherently ordered by chronological order. If a pattern 
emerges in later time periods for example, your model may still pick 
up on it even if that effect doesn’t hold in earlier years!
You’ll want to do something like forward chaining where you’ll be 
able to model on past data then look at forward-facing data.
• fold 1 : training [1], test [2]
• fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3]
• fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4]
• fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5]
• fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]"
How is a decision tree pruned?,"Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have 
weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity 
of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree 
model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with 
approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity prun-
ing.
Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each 
node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While 
simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that 
would optimize for maximum accuracy."
"Which is more important to you– model accuracy, or 
model performance?","This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning 
model performance! Machine learning interview questions often look 
towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can 
perform worse in predictive power — how does that make sense?
Well, it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a sub-
set of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one. 
For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with 
a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict 
no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, 
this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to 
find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this 
help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the 
be-all and end-all of model performance."
What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?,"The F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted 
average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 
1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would 
use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much."
How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?,"An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification 
test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an 
accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on 
the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the 
hump:
1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.
2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.
3- Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.
What’s important here is that you have a keen sense for what damage 
an unbalanced dataset can cause, and how to balance that."
When should you use classification over regression?,"Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict catego-
ries, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to 
better distinguish differences between individual points. You would 
use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect 
the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit 
categories (ex: If you wanted to know whether a name was male or 
female rather than just how correlated they were with male and 
female names.)"
"Name an example where ensemble techniques might 
be useful.","Ensemble techniques use a combination of learning algorithms to 
optimize better predictive performance. They typically reduce overfit-
ting in models and make the model more robust (unlikely to be influ-
enced by small changes in the training data). 
You could list some examples of ensemble methods, from bagging to 
boosting to a “bucket of models” method and demonstrate how they 
could increase predictive power."
"How do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a 
model?","This is a simple restatement of a fundamental problem in machine 
learning: the possibility of overfitting training data and carrying the 
noise of that data through to the test set, thereby providing inaccu-
rate generalizations.
There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:
1- Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account 
fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise 
in the training data.
2- Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.
3- Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain 
model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting."
"What evaluation approaches would you work to 
gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?","You would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or per-
haps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset 
into composite sets of training and test sets within the data. You 
should then implement a choice selection of performance metrics: 
here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as 
the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix. What’s 
important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of 
how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance 
measures for the right situations."
How would you evaluate a logistic regression model?,"A subsection of the question above. You have to demonstrate an 
understanding of what the typical goals of a logistic regression are 
(classification, prediction, etc.) and bring up a few examples and use 
cases."
What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?,"The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-
dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of 
points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the 
inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature 
space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the 
coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally 
cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates. Many algo-
rithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel 
trick enables us effectively run algorithms in a high-dimensional 
space with lower-dimensional data."
"How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a 
dataset?","You could find missing/corrupted data in a dataset and either drop 
those rows or columns, or decide to replace them with another value.
In Pandas, there are two very useful methods: isnull() and dropna() 
that will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted 
data and drop those values. If you want to fill the invalid values with 
a placeholder value (for example, 0), you could use the fillna() 
method."
"Do you have experience with Spark or big data tools 
for machine learning?","You’ll want to get familiar with the meaning of big data for different 
companies and the different tools they’ll want. Spark is the big data 
tool most in demand now, able to handle immense datasets with 
speed. Be honest if you don’t have experience with the tools 
demanded, but also take a look at job descriptions and see what tools 
pop up: you’ll want to invest in familiarizing yourself with them."
"Pick an algorithm. Write the psuedo-code for a paral-
lel implementation.","This kind of question demonstrates your ability to think in parallel-
ism and how you could handle concurrency in programming imple-
mentations dealing with big data. Take a look at pseudocode 
frameworks such as Peril-L and visualization tools such as Web 
Sequence Diagrams to help you demonstrate your ability to write code 
that reflects parallelism."
"What are some differences between a linked list and 
an array?","An array is an ordered collection of objects. A linked list is a series of 
objects with pointers that direct how to process them sequentially. An 
array assumes that every element has the same size, unlike the linked 
list. A linked list can more easily grow organically: an array has to be 
pre-defined or re-defined for organic growth. Shuffling a linked list 
involves changing which points direct where — meanwhile, shuffling 
an array is more complex and takes more memory."
Describe a hash table.,"A hash table is a data structure that produces an associative array. A 
key is mapped to certain values through the use of a hash function. 
They are often used for tasks such as database indexing."
"Which data visualization libraries do you use?","Popular tools include R’s ggplot, Python’s seaborn and matplotlib, and 
tools such as Plot.ly and Tableau."
